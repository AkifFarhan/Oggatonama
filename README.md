## **Oggatonama**  
### *A  Platform for Identifying Unclaimed Dead Bodies*

---

##  Introduction

Every year, numerous unidentified dead bodies are found across different locations. Due to the lack of a centralized and accessible system, many of these individuals remain unidentified, causing immense suffering for families searching for their missing loved ones.

**Oggatonama** aims to bridge this gap by creating a digital platform that helps authorities and the public collaboratively identify unclaimed dead bodies in a structured, ethical, and efficient manner.

---

## Project Objective

The main objectives of **Oggatonama** are:

- To maintain a centralized database of unidentified dead bodies
- To assist families in locating missing persons
- To reduce the time and complexity involved in identification
- To ensure transparency and accountability through authority verification

---

##  Website Overview

**Oggatonama** will be a web-based platform with two primary functionalities:

1. **Viewing and Searching Listed Dead Bodies**
2. **Submitting Dead Body Information for Listing**

---

A publicly accessible list of unidentified dead bodies will be available.  
Users can easily search and filter entries using different criteria.

All submitted data will be stored along with the submitter’s information to ensure accountability.

2. The claim request will include:
   - Applicant details
   - Relationship with the deceased
   - Supporting documents
3. **Authorities will review** the claim carefully.
4. Only after proper verification will the claim be approved or rejected.

## Target Audience

The target audience for **Oggatonama** includes:

- Individuals who have **lost a family member or relative** and are searching for missing persons  
- People who have **found an unidentified dead body** and want to report it responsibly  
- Law enforcement agencies and local authorities involved in identification and verification  
- Hospitals, NGOs, and social service organizations working with missing persons  

This platform is designed to be accessible to the general public while maintaining authority-controlled verification.

---

## Technology Stack

The system will be developed using modern, scalable, and reliable technologies.

### Backend Technologies
- **Laravel (PHP)**
- **Node.js**
- **MySQL** 

---

### Frontend Technologies
- **React.js** – for building a responsive and interactive user interface
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – for layout, styling, and client-side logic

---

## Rendering Method

The platform will use a **hybrid rendering approach** to balance performance, SEO, and interactivity.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Used for:
- Public dead body listings
- Search results pages
- Individual dead body detail pages  

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial page load
- Better SEO and search visibility
- Improved performance on low-end devices

---

###  Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Used for:
- Claim submission forms
- Admin and authority dashboards
- Verification and approval workflows  

**Benefits:**
- Smooth user interaction
- Dynamic updates without page reload
- Better user experience for authenticated users

---
##  AI API Implementation

Our web app will use **AI text similarity APIs** to compare newly added dead body reports with existing records. If a high similarity is found, the system will **flag probable duplicate reports** for authority review.  
AI will assist only, and **final decisions will be made by authorized personnel**.

---
### Final Approach
**A hybrid model combining both SSR and CSR**  
This ensures reliability, performance, and scalability while serving both public users and authorities efficiently.

---

## Security & Ethics

- Sensitive data will be protected
- Access control for editing and verification
- Authority-only approval system
- Respectful and ethical handling of information

---

## Expected Impact

- Faster identification of missing persons
- Reduced emotional distress for families
- Improved coordination between public and authorities
- Digital transformation of a critical social service
